Memory Card game written in React as part of the Odin Project.

The focus of this piece of work was to complete a simple React app with some basic functionality.

What is striking is the simplicity of the application compared to previous projects where I was manipulating the DOM manually using JS. React really removes the need to update the view at various logical points in the game lifecycle. It's a huge benefit. For example, the To-Do List project took me days and days to complete due to tripping over DOM logic and having to refactor it. It was more complex than this project, but this project has taken less than 90 minutes to implement including sourcing the images.
